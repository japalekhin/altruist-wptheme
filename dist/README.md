# Altruist WordPress Theme

![](screenshot.png?raw=true)

**Altruist** is an honorware (free) WordPress theme for semi-personal, semi-professional developer blogs with a focus on the concept of **altruism**.

Suited for those guys who like to help people and offer free software and content, only asking people to:

> Pay what you can, when you can.

This is the next iteration of [Devin'](https://github.com/japalekhin/devin-wptheme) another free WordPress theme for developers.

## ü§ó Support

An example of an honorware is this project itself. It's free for use by anybody and expect nothing in return.

If this is of any interest or you find this useful. Please consider becoming a patron on Patreon *if you can, when you can*.

Doing so will also support all my other projects and tutorials.

## ‚ùï Important Note

This project has a status of `alpha`. Most things are hard-coded as the customizer functionality for these things are not yet developed.

The social links, for example, are hard-coded to my profiles so you have to change those manually if you want to use this theme, for now.

## Getting Started

1. Have a WordPress website ready.
2. Download or clone this project.
3. Modify to your heart's content (or don't, it's really up to you).
4. Upload it to your WordPress website and activate.
5. Enjoy helping people.

## Sample Config
`./config/mailgun.php`
```php
<?php
$mailgunConfig = new stdClass();
$mailgunConfig->apiKey = 'the key';
$mailgunConfig->domain = 'the domain';
```
