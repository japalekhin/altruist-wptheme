# Altruist

![](screenshot.png?raw=true)

**Altruist** is a free WordPress theme for semi-personal, semi-professional developer blogs with a focus on the concept of **honorware**.

Suited for those guys who like to help people and offer free software and content, only asking people to:

> Pay what you can, when you can.

This is the next iteration of [Devin'](https://github.com/japalekhin/devin-wp-theme) another free WordPress theme for developers.

## Support

An example of an honorware is this theme itself. It's free for use by anybody and expect nothing in return.

If this is of any interest or you find this useful. Please consider becoming a patron on Patreon *if you can, when you can*.

Doing so will also support all my other projects and tutorials.
